* Dotfiles

** Todo:
   - [ ] Fix illegible highlighting on \` and \[\] characters (maybe more)
   - [ ] Learn more Norg stuff (this todo-list is pretty nifty)
   - [ ] Learn more Treesitter stuff

** NVIM

   The `runtimepath` and `packpath` (usually the same) should be something like ~/.config/nvim

*** Interesting Plugins:
    - https://github.com/glacambre/firenvim -- NVIM in the browser. Probably doesn't work with Orion :sob:
